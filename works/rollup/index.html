        <p>This project was realized during a workshop (project created by group in one week). The goal was to learn the
            basics of code on processing using an Arduino distance sensor.</p>

        <p>Our group decided to make a "digital" version of the roll-up game. When the ball was moving on the
            rails, a score was displayed on the screen while playing the video.</p>

        <p>The workshops are for me the moments where I learn the fastest, because there is a time limit and we are
            focused on the project all week. These projects also teach group work, you have to manage to divide the work
            equally without losing time. In our case, one person did the music, the other did the waiting screen (screen
            that is displayed while waiting for someone to play) and I did the looping animation.</p>
