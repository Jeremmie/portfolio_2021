        <p>These photos are the result of a photography project. We were in groups of two and had to do a still life on
            the theme of kitchen objects. <br>
            We decided to base the project on the movement of water. So we took an aquarium, threw objects such as
            glasses, sponges and knives and here are the ones that gave the best results. <br>
            Finally, with the retouching, and the shapes of the water, the objects are almost no longer recognizable,
            which I find adds mystery to the photos and leaves room for the viewer's imagination.
